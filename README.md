# Zeus Encryption
Zeus Encryption is the world's first AES/SHA-256 encryption application running on the decentralised smart contracts Ethereum Classic Network. Built with a combination of Solidity and Javascript/Html, the program accepts deposits of 10,000 ZEUS tokens in return for a passphrase protected encryption/decryption service on Ethereum Classic blockchain.

## 1. How to Use Zeus Encryption dApp

We introduce our first decentralized application in the Zeus ecosystem with an AES/SHA-256 encryption program written in Solidity and deployed to Ethereum Classic blockchain. 
As a Turing-complete EVM, you can interact with Ethereum Classic using MetaMask Wallet application to interface with the UI and operate the Zeus Encryption program.

However, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as endless repetition, poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance,
we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.
DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. 
To support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.
