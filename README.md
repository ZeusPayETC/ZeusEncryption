# Zeus Encryption
Zeus Encryption is the world's first AES/SHA-256 encryption application running on the decentralised smart contracts Ethereum Classic Network. Built with a combination of Solidity and Javascript/Html, the program accepts deposits of 10,000 ZEUS tokens in return for a passphrase protected encryption/decryption service on Ethereum Classic blockchain.

## 1. How to Use Zeus Encryption dApp

We introduce our first decentralized application in the Zeus ecosystem with an AES/SHA-256 encryption program written in Solidity and deployed to Ethereum Classic blockchain. 
As a Turing-complete EVM, you can interact with Ethereum Classic using MetaMask Wallet application to interface with the UI and operate the Zeus Encryption program.

## 2. Ethereum Classic Network Configuration
Ethereum Classic blockchain which runs the ZEUS token smart contract and Zeus Encryption smart contract share similar charactristics to Ethereum, except proof-of-work algorithm and different Remote Procedure Call RPC network settings to connect to the blockchain.
- Network Name: Ethereum Classic

- New RPC URL: https://etc.rivet.link

- Chain ID: 61

- Currency Symbol (optional): ETC

- Block Explorer URL (optional): https://blockscout.com/etc/mainnet/

## 3. How to Acquire ZEUS to Operate Zeus Encryption Program
ZEUS is an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum Classic blockchain and can be swapped for underlying asset ETC.
- ZEUS Contract Address: 0x66e97838A985cf070B9F955c4025f1C7825de44F

After acquiring ETC from your favorite CEX, head over to https://app.hebeswap.com and swap some ETC for ZEUS on the decentralised exchange.
Remember to add the ZEUS token contract address in HebeSwap DeX and add to your token list.
