# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Zeus Encryption
Zeus Encryption is the world's first AES/SHA-256 encryption application running on the decentralised smart contracts Ethereum Classic Network. Built with a combination of Solidity and Javascript/Html, the program accepts deposits of 10,000 ZEUS tokens in return for a passphrase protected encryption/decryption service on Ethereum Classic blockchain.

## 1. How to Use Zeus Encryption dApp

We introduce <a href="https://www.zeusencryption.app/" onclick="window.open('https://www.zeusencryption.app/', '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer'); return false;">zeusencryption.app</a> our first decentralized application in the Zeus ecosystem with an AES/SHA-256 encryption program written in Solidity and deployed to Ethereum Classic blockchain. 
As a Turing-complete EVM, you can interact with Ethereum Classic using MetaMask Wallet application to interface with the UI and operate the Zeus Encryption program.
For those not familiar with ETC network configuration, scan the QR code in the image above or access this article for step-by-step instructions: <a href="https://bit.ly/ZeusProject" onclick="window.open('https://bit.ly/ZeusProject', '_blank', 'noopener,noreferrer'); return false;">Visit Zeus Project</a>

## 2. Ethereum Classic Network Configuration
Ethereum Classic blockchain which runs the ZEUS token smart contract and Zeus Encryption smart contract share similar charactristics to Ethereum, except proof-of-work algorithm and different Remote Procedure Call RPC network settings to connect to the blockchain.
- Network Name: Ethereum Classic

- New RPC URL: https://etc.rivet.link

- Chain ID: ``61``

- Currency Symbol (optional): ``ETC``

- Block Explorer URL (optional): https://blockscout.com/etc/mainnet/

## 3. How to Acquire ZEUS to Operate Zeus Encryption Program
ZEUS is an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum Classic blockchain and can be swapped for underlying asset ETC.
- ZEUS Contract Address: ``0x66e97838A985cf070B9F955c4025f1C7825de44F``

After acquiring ETC from your favorite CEX, head over to https://app.hebeswap.com and swap some ETC for ZEUS on the decentralised exchange.
Remember to add the ZEUS token contract address in HebeSwap DeX and add to your token list.

## 4. How to Run Zeus Encryption Program Locally on Your Machine
You can run Zeus Encryption application locally on your machine using NodeJS and npm server instace with instructions below:
- Access the NodeJS website and download the NodeJS LTS package https://nodejs.org/en
- Install NodeJS and open CMD as admin and check the instance of npm server running by typing ``npm -v``
- Proceed to install live server globally using this command: ``npm install -g live-server``
- Once install is complete you can download the ZeusEncryption v1.2 file from GitHub and store in C:\ZeusEncryption
- Navigate your folder structure using ``cd..`` or ``cd`` "FolderName" until your directory points to the C:\ZeusEncryption folder
- You can now launch the application by typing ``live-server`` into CMD command prompt. Wait for application to open on 127.0.0.1:8080
- Zeus Encryption should now open and you can connect your wallet, deposit 10,000 ZEUS and proceed to encrypt/decrypt your data.

## 5. Future Project Development
As the community around the project forms and continues to grow in anticipation for the launch of ZEUS Mail, we encourage education to onboard new people to experience the innovative solutions presented by blockchain networks and applications. Follow our social channels for updates on the project including our digital celestial art artifacts.
