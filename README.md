# Zeus Encryption
Zeus Encryption is the world's first AES/SHA-256 encryption application running on the decentralised smart contracts Ethereum Classic Network. Built with a combination of Solidity and Javascript/Html, the program accepts deposits of 10,000 ZEUS tokens in return for a passphrase protected encryption/decryption service on Ethereum Classic blockchain.

## 1. How to Use Zeus Encryption dApp

We introduce our first decentralized application in the Zeus ecosystem with an AES/SHA-256 encryption program written in Solidity and deployed to Ethereum Classic blockchain. 
As a Turing-complete EVM, you can interact with Ethereum Classic using MetaMask Wallet application to interface with the UI and operate the Zeus Encryption program.

## 2. Ethereum Classic Network Configuration
Ethereum Classic blockchain which runs the ZEUS token smart contract and Zeus Encryption smart contract share similar charactristics to Ethereum, except proof-of-work algorithm and different Remote Procedure Call RPC network settings to connect to the blockchain.
- Network Name: Ethereum Classic

- New RPC URL: https://etc.rivet.link

- Chain ID: 61

- Currency Symbol (optional): ETC

- Block Explorer URL (optional): https://blockscout.com/etc/mainnet/

## 3. How to Acquire ZEUS to Operate Zeus Encryption Program
we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates cold-start data before RL.
DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1 across math, code, and reasoning tasks. 
To support the research community, we have open-sourced DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Llama and Qwen. DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B outperforms OpenAI-o1-mini across various benchmarks, achieving new state-of-the-art results for dense models.
